# Crowd-Drawing

Implements a simple drawing app. It was written for my workshop about *Crowdsourcing and the Interwebs*, held at the EFPSA 2014 [Congress](http://more.efpsa.org/congress2014/) in Romania.
This little freudian experiment was inspired by [drawtogether](https://github.com/NYUCCL/drawtogether).

To get the code, run
```
git clone https://github.com/dostodabsi/crowd-drawing
```
